# Overview

The `shopify-oauth-worker` project provides a seamless integration for developers looking to connect Shopify storefronts with browser extensions using Cloudflare Workers. This lightweight solution allows for efficient authentication and API interactions, ensuring a smooth user experience.

# Getting Started

To get started with `shopify-oauth-worker`, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. Ensure you have a Shopify Partner account to create your app and obtain necessary credentials. Follow the setup instructions in this wiki to configure your environment.

# Cloudflare Workers Integration

This project leverages Cloudflare Workers to provide a serverless environment that handles OAuth authentication and API requests. By using Cloudflare's global network, your application benefits from low latency and high availability.

# Using Wrangler to Deploy

Wrangler is a command-line tool that simplifies the deployment of Cloudflare Workers. Use the following commands to initialize and deploy your worker:

1. Install Wrangler: `npm install -g wrangler`
2. Configure your `wrangler.toml` file with your project settings.
3. Deploy your worker: `wrangler publish`

# Gateway API Architecture

The architecture of the `shopify-oauth-worker` is designed to act as a gateway between Shopify's API and your browser extension. It handles authentication flows, token management, and API requests, abstracting the complexities of direct interactions with Shopify.

# Example Usage

Here's a quick example of how to initiate an OAuth flow using the `shopify-oauth-worker`:

```javascript
fetch('/oauth/start')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```

This fetch call starts the OAuth process, redirecting users to Shopify for authentication.

# Advanced Topics

For developers looking to extend the functionality of the `shopify-oauth-worker`, consider exploring custom middleware and additional API integrations. The project supports various authentication strategies that can be tailored to specific needs.
